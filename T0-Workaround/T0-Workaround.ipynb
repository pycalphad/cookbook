    "# 2019-07-19: T0 Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to be able to compute the thermodynamic quantity T0 (T-zero) using pycalphad. This is currently (as of 0.8.3) a challenge because global minimization cannot be turned off in `equilibrium`. In this workaround example, we changed the calculation to use direct energy calculation with `calculate()` and bypass `equilibrium()` altogether to avoid global min issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is pretty fast, but the downside is as you go to higher-order systems you will have to increase the pdens value (which increases RAM usage). The other disadvantage is accuracy, which is +- 10 K relative to the true (from the model) value, and it gets worse as you increase the number of components. This approximation should probably not be used with more than three independent components."
